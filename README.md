# fCC.FEL.RandomQuoteGenerator
Third time is the charm, perhaps.  Fresh repository, fresh vscode file folder, still hitting that weird shell error but LETSGOOOO

This is the third attempt to upload the Random Quote Generator project to Netlify.
Attempt #1 somehow ended up coming from a subfolder which triggered an error that was more difficult to resolve than I expected.
I tried adding a _redirects file when it failed to build on netlify. I ended up creating an additional repository, with netlify in the name to try and resolve this issue in a different manner.

Those things didn't work.

This version has the added _redirects file, but now lacks the subfolder.
